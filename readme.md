## Version Alpha 1.0; January, 2017

Pemburnia Invoicing was originally written using Fusebox PHP framework around 2007.  
Fusebox PHP has long since disappeared, making the job of maintaining the software 
more difficult with each passing year.  The new version is based on Laravel 5, and
incorporates the Zizaco Entrust role-based access control (RBAC) system (https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust).
